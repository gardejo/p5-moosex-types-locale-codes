### New Feature(s)

-   Unificated (reorganized) following modules into the distribution.
    See each predecessor distributions to learn about their revision history:
    -   `MooseX::Types::Locale::Codes::Country`
        from `MooseX::Types::Locale::Country` in `MooseX-Types-Locale-Country`
        for `Locale::Codes::Country`
    -   `MooseX::Types::Locale::Codes::Language`
        from `MooseX::Types::Locale::Language` in `MooseX-Types-Locale-Language`
        for `Locale::Codes::Language`
-   Added new type constraints with coercions for the rest of locales:
    -   `MooseX::Types::Locale::Codes::Currency`
        for `Locale::Codes::Currency`
    -   `MooseX::Types::Locale::Codes::LanguageExtension`
        for `Locale::Codes::LangExt`

    -   `MooseX::Types::Locale::Codes::Script`
        for `Locale::Codes::Script`

### Change(s)

-   Incompatibly changed APIs:
    Type constraints are now parameterizable.
    You can use a parameter as a code set to any type constraint.
    Formally you had to use several type constraints.
    If you prefer the old APIs to new APIs, please use predecessor modules.

### Improvement(s)

-   Improved type coercions about `numeric` code sets.
    For example, you can coerce '12' to '012' as a country code.

### Bug Fix(es)

-   Fixed the problem:
    A type constraints do not follow changes in internal data of each
    `Locale::Codes::*` modules by `rename_XXX`, `add_XXX`, `delete_XXX`,
    `rename_XXX`, `add_XXX_code_alias` and `delete_XXX_code_alias`.
    All modules in the distribution are no longer had cache of locale data.

### Documentation

-   Improved documents.

### Test(s)
